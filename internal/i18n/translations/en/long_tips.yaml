- Key: tip_on_hijack
  Default: >
    This tool provides an HTTP proxy service. After setting the software as a system proxy or correctly configuring it
    in another proxy tool, it will intercept video requests from specific sites and return the video content instead of
    the actual server, enabling video preloading.
    Therefore, this tool will only work if the proxy settings are configured correctly.


    - "Enable HTTPS Hijacking": Custom video URLs entered by players (such as BiliBili videos) are typically under HTTPS.
    By enabling this switch and configuring the certificate in the software directory as a
    "Trusted Root Certification Authority", these videos can be intercepted if the tool supports preloading of such videos.

    - "Sites to be intercepted": If you do not want the tool to intercept certain sites (such as BiliBili and WannaDance),
    you can click the button corresponding to the site to disable it.

- Key: tip_on_proxy
  Default: >
    Set the proxy server URL used by this tool when downloading videos, thumbnails, and calling APIs.
    Leaving the text box blank means direct access without going through the proxy server (and ignoring the system proxy).
    Click the "Test" button to check whether the service can be accessed under the current settings.

- Key: tip_on_keys
  Default: >
    Set the API key that comes with this software when accessing some APIs that require authentication,
    such as the YouTube API. You can apply for it in the Google Cloud console.

- Key: tip_on_cache
  Default: >
    The cache is used to store preloaded videos. Video downloads and responses are performed in the cache directory
    to reduce memory usage.


    - Setting the cache folder on a network device is not recommended, as the tool's frequent file reads and writes and
    directory traversal may incur significant network overhead, potentially impacting the streaming experience.

    - When the total cache file size exceeds the configured size, the tool will automatically delete the oldest
    downloaded videos. Setting the cache size too large is not recommended, as this may affect cache traversal efficiency.


    About cache file formats:


    - Continuous: Saves in the vrcdp format and supports resumable downloads.

    - Fragmented: Saves in the vrcdp format and supports both resumable downloads and fragmented downloads,
    shortening loading times for videos that are playing mid-stream.

    - Legacy: Saves in the mp4 and dl formats and supports resumable downloads. These formats are now deprecated.
    If you experience issues with the first two formats, try using the legacy format instead.
